In order to run the code click run in Eclipse/IntelliJ, this will load up the initial menu frame.
From there enter your player names and the amount of points you would like to play to and click the 'Start' button to run the program.

When you're in the actual game you can enter e.g. 'move 1 7' (in the command input box) to move the checker on position 1 to position 7.
You can also enter the letters "A-Z" (or if there are 27 moves then "AA" etc.) to make the move corresponding to that letter in the list
of available moves which is posted in the message panel on the right hand side of the board.
NOTE: We have also made it possible to move the checkers using clicks. Simply click the checker you want to move and then the possible
positions you can move the checker to will light up in the form of a green checker. Then click the position you want to move the checker to
in order to move it to that position. i.e. click on the green checker.

Click the 'Roll Dice' button to roll the dice. You can only roll once per turn.
We have also made it more interactive meaning you must click the 'Roll Dice' button yourself at the beginning of each go to roll the dice.
To move onto the next player you can enter 'next' in the command input window and click enter or click the 'next user' button, however this is 
unnecessary as the program will move onto the next move when it should do.

Enter 'cheat' to jump to the 'cheat position' outlined in the assignments PDF for sprint 4.
